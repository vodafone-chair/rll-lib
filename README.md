# Readme
MATLAB library for runlength-limited (RLL) coding. This library contains encoders and decoders, to utilize the RLL codes derived in [1], [2]. The functions can, e.g., be used to implement zero-crossing modulation (ZXM).

## Getting Started
The file `minimumWorkingExample.m` provides a quick start.

## List of Main Functions
- `rllEncoderFct.m` performs RLL encoding using the FSM RLL codes derived in [1], [2]
- `rllBcjrFct.m` performs RLL soft-input soft-output decoding by implementing the Bahl-Cocke-Jelinek-Raviv (BCJR) algorithm as proposed in [1], [2]
- `rllViterbiFct.m` performs minimum Hamming distance decoding of the RLL sequences by implementing the Viterbi algorithm as proposed in [Algorithm 1, 4]
- `getFsmRllAutocorrFct.m` computes the autocorrelation function of the RLL sequences generated by the FSM encoders as described in [1], [3]
